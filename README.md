# Movie Box Office Regression


This project aims to leverage the entire data science lifecycle to effectively understand trends in movie box office revenues and predict box office revenues using various machine learning techniques. Successful movies generate millions and even billions of dollars in revenue. For instance, some of the highest grossing movies for box office revenue like Avengers: Endgame, Avatar, and the Titanic achieved lifetime box office gross revenues of $2799439100, $2923706026, and $2264750694 respectively. 
As we can see from these examples, being able to accurately predict the total box office revenue of a movie is crucial for those who work in the movie industry (ex. directors, producers, actors, etc.), as it will help them better understand how they can optimize various aspects of the movie creation and promotion pipeline to improve box office revenue. 
However, the challenge that comes with predicting box office revenue is that large amount of factors that can effect how successful a movie is, such as budget, critics ratings (ex. rotten tomatoes ratings), release dates, genre, runtime, production companies, etc. In our tutorial, we have collected data on these various factors to train machine learning models to predict a given movie's box office revenue on several different models.

Our project will cover our process for data collection, data cleaning and processing, as well as visualizations of correlations and trends in the data. Finally the last two sections of our project will cover our prediction models themselves as well as the conclusions that we drew from said models.
